# BiathlonAPI
R code to read the API from the Biathlon Results webpage

I wrote some code in R-Studio to read data from the Biathlonresults API with the end goal to pull some data regarding shooting statistics, specifically standing and prone, and ski statististics.

I added comments in the code to explain what segments of code are doing.

AT this point the result is a csv file with all female athletes of the 2019-2020 season with some bio-information as well as the statistics mentioned earlier.
